<h1> Long Story </h1>
<p> Nice ok let me start at the beginning.</p>

<p>I was born in Madera California. I have three sisters no brothers.
I moved a lot, so books were my bestfriends.
Which is good because I learned a lot.
I was put into the G.A.T.E program at school for accelerated learning.
I loved that because we were introduced to computers before most students and always went on cool fieldtrips. I was kind of a nerd through elementary. My mom loved that.
She was always so proud of me because I wanted to be a scientist. I never had the heart to tell her the reason for that was because most superheroes got their powers from scientific explosions and accidents and i so wanted super powers.
</p>
<p>My dad would either be working out or reading. He was an athelete.
His hero was Bruce Lee. So Bruce Lee was automatically my hero. So he pushed me always to take care of my health and work out. So he would put me in every sport he could afford to. He really pushed me in Taekwondo. In 1994 I became a blackbelt. When Taekwondo became an Olympic event I went and won at state championships, but got bronze at nationals. I have very fond memories and am very grateful for him to teach me drive and determination.
</p>
<p>
	The side affect of all that training was good and bad.
	The bad thing is my focus became less on school and more on sports.
	The good is I became extremely popular in highschool as a football player. I sometimes wonder how things would have turned out if I had stayed focused on school at that age.
</p>

<p>
	I did graduate from F.I.T on the dean's list.
	I  will finish this later because I have a lot of work to do on the rest of my project.
</p>
